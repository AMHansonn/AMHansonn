- 👋 Hi, I’m @AMHansonn
- 👀 I’m interested in computer science. I am currently focusing on building my knowledge in Python.
- 🌱 I’m currently a High School student. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything! I'm always seeking knowledge.
- I am strong in HTML and CSS, I'm getting better with Python, and in the future I would like to learn and/or get better with languages such as C, C++, Java, C#, Swift, and Javascript. I have basic knowledge in all of those languages, but I don't use them much and they're not my priority right now.
