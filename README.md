### Student | (Computer) Scientist | Healthcare Professional | Aspiring Physician-Scientist

I am a College Student at East Carolina University working to become a doctor in the future. However, computer science is an incredibly interesting field, and having a working knowledge of it is incredibly helpful in any field. I am also working to become a researcher in the future, so learning languages like Python and R will be very helpful for me.
